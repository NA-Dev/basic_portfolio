            <p>
                Creating accessible avenues for impacful expression, positive and inclusive community building, promoting enterpreneurship, and helping others achieve financial independence are important to me. Recently, I transitioned from mechanical engineer to junior web developer in order to more productively work toward these goals in the Richmond, Virginia area.
            </p>
            <p>
                My past work has been in a wide variety of areas: cell-phone and skin care sales; small-scale design, manufacturing, and quality validation for a NASA contractor; project management, resource scheduling, and data-driven process monitoring for a power company; assembly process optimization; and product engineering for a Tier 1 automotive interior supplier, and structural analysis of bridges for overweight vehicles at VDOT.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of these experiences, I saw immense value in battling <i>systematic</i> productivity killers: difficulty in or lack of automation, mis-aligned or unclear goals, information inaccessibility, disorganized communication, and slow adoption of new technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I hope to use web technology to battle these ilk. With great websites and applications, you can get your business or organization running smoothly with less work, find out how your business can most effectively provide value to customers, and give you time to give back to the communities you are passionate about.
